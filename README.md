##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on Milestone 1, and I love the idea. Your code looks great, and your project has been set up correctly. Your milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

##Milestone 2 Feedback
This is awesome, love what you have here. Let's focus on creating the first 4 top level pages for the MVP (Home, News, Rankings, Articles) - with the rest of the content and features slated for stretch goals. Do you have content ready to publish?

This project really could be almost capstone level if you'd like to take it there. At the very least, some kind of blogging platform/CMS for publishing the news and articles feeds will be needed down the line (Wordpress, Drupal, Ghost, etc.) - but unfortunately that's out of scope for now. 

But we can set this project up as a static Bootstrap site for MVP and this will provide you with a template. A blogging platform/CMS can be installed and integrated by you down the line. You can use this PWP to build a theme for whatever CMS/blog platform you might choose later. A blogging platform/CMS will enable you to tag, filter, and sort all of your news items and articles, and provide easy mod_rewrite() access for permalinking your content. (ASO and most other web hosts will provide ready-to-go installer scripts in CPanel for these blogging platforms.)

####What's in scope:
I'm thinking the [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) API might be a good fit for your mailing list - and that can be integrated as part of PWP. Also, we can use a jQuery plugin like [Sortable](http://github.hubspot.com/sortable/) to enable sorting on your rankings table.

Your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice work.

## Milestone 3 Feeback
Nice work, this layout should be pretty straightforward in Bootstrap. Since you have so much work ahead of you in TrailQuail, you may even consider trimming down the layout even a bit more. I love this idea, and hope you take it forward using some kind of blogging platform/CMS. 

Maybe consider placing the logo/sitename and nav links on the same line, together in the navbar, and having the nav links collapse on mobile.

Having horizontal text links on mobile can be troublesome sometimes on very small screens. Sometimes there's just not enough room. If you don't want a collapsed nav, think about maybe having those links stacked on mobile. 

Also, refer to my Milestone 2 feedback for some links to some libraries you might want to check out. (Totally optional.)  

Nice work. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier III. Go ahead and get started on development.
