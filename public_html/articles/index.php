			<h2 class="inline-block">Miami Heat</h2>
			<img src="../img/heat.png" alt="heat" class="inline-block pull-right logo"></div>
		<ul>
			<li>Gerald Green</li>
			<li>Josh Richardson*</li>
			<li>Amar'e Stoudemire</li>
			<li>Justice Winslow*</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This offseason, the Heat fixed up their bench and that is where all these players will remain until the injury
			bug hits. Green will add scoring and 3's and is the only one here worth a second thought.</p>

			<h2 class="inline-block">Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
			<img src="../img/bucks.png" alt="bucks" class="inline-block pull-right logo"></div>
		<ul>
			<li>Chris Copeland</li>
			<li>Greg Monroe</li>
			<li>Greivis Vasquez</li>
			<li>Rashad Vaughn*</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Greg Monroe should continue to be a double-double machine, especially given that he no longer has to split time
			with Andre Drummond. Vaughn will add 3's and Vasquez, given the minutes, has proven to be a good source of
			assists.</p>

			<h2 class="inline-block">Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
			<img src="../img/timberwolves.png" alt="timberwolves" class="inline-block pull-right logo"></div>
		<ul>
			<li>Nemanja Bjelica*</li>
			<li>Tyus Jones*</li>
			<li>Andre Miller</li>
			<li>Tayshaun Prince</li>
			<li>Damjan Rudez</li>
			<li>Karl-Anthony Towns*</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A team that is in rebuilding mode should allow for Towns to get plenty of minutes and be a valuable asset to
			your fantasy team. Bjelica and Jones are worth keeping an eye on to see how they develop, but for now just
			stick with The Karl.</p>

			<img src="../img/pelicans.png" alt="pelicans" class="inline-block pull-right logo"></div>
		<ul>
			<li>Alonzo Gee</li>
			<li>Kendrick Perkins</li>
			<li>Nate Robinson</li>
			<li>Ish Smith</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Until Holiday gets healthy, Ish & Robinson should get the opportunity to get serious minutes at PG and could be
			a good way to get some assists and steals. Gee could get some run until Christmas when Tyreke Evans
			returns.</p>

			<h2 class="inline-block">New York Knicks</h2>
			<img src="../img/knicks.png" alt="knicks" class="inline-block pull-right logo"></div>
		<ul>
			<li>Arron Afflalo</li>
			<li>Jerian Grant*</li>
			<li>Robin Lopez</li>
			<li>Kyle O'Quinn</li>
			<li>Kristaps Porzingis*</li>
			<li>Kevin Seraphin</li>
			<li>Sasha Vujacic</li>
			<li>Derrick Williams</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Williams, Lopez, Afflalo, and O'Quinn should all get enough minutes to provide sufficient fantasy numbers. If
			Porzingis is what the Knicks hope he can be, he should be a player to look at late in your draft.</p>
